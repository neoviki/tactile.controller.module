# Tactile Controller Module

The Tactile Controller Module is an interface board designed to read tactile sensor data from a dedicated sensor module containing 36 sensors (currently under development and not yet publicly available). It is powered by the PIC32MM0256GPM036 microcontroller in a UQFN 40-pin package. The module is built to sample and manage data from high-density tactile sensor arrays, offering flexible communication options via IÂ²C, hardware SPI (HW SPI), and software SPI (SW SPI) protocols.

## Features

- **Microcontroller:** PIC32MM0256GPM036 (UQFN-40)  
- **Protocols Supported:**
  - IÂ²C  
  - Hardware SPI (HW SPI)  
  - Software SPI (SW SPI)  
- **Application:** 
  - Interfaces with high-density tactile sensor arrays  
  - Suitable for applications requiring customizable sampling and interfacing logic  

## Use Case

The controller module is primarily used to sample sensor data from a high-density tactile sensing module with 36 sensors. It communicates with the tactile sensing module using a software SPI protocol. Designed for applications such as robotics, touch-sensitive interfaces, and pressure-mapping systems, the tactile sensing module provides detailed tactile measurements, specifically pressure data. The controller runs essential firmware to acquire and format the sampled data, and transmits the tactile sensor data to an external system (such as a connected computer or robot) via a hardware SPI protocol.

## Additional Details

- **Pin headers** are provided for programming the MCU and interfacing with external sensors and components.  
- **Low-power operation** and compact form factor make it ideal for embedded systems and portable tactile solutions.  
- Firmware development and sensor interfacing can be customized based on specific application needs.
