# Bugs

In Tactile CTR the following PINS are not working

 MOSI0 : RA4
 MISO2 : RB4

 According to datasheet "RA4 and RB4 pins are controlled by the SOSC": SOSC is clock

 in the next hardware don't use RA4 and RB4.

# Recommendation

 Also don't use RB11 and RB13 ( I didn't test these pins, it might work but try not to use )
